# Sampling
The code here is used for generating a small, representative sample of the entire population space assuming you have the population pdf.

The problem of creating a small, representative sample is a problem with many practical applications. It is very difficult to analyze large datasets, so we can only analyze a smaller sample. However, when a sample is significantly smaller than the original data set, we lose a significant portion of information about the original population. As such, we need to create an efficient way to take small samples that are very representative of the original data set.

Currently, the code only works on single dimensional data, though it shall be adjusted to work on multidimensional data using the same algorithm.
